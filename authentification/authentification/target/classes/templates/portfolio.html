<h1>Welcome to the Portfolio Management</h1>
<p>Short deadline made it too long to modify the database generated with the spring security to add the portfolio type to it (that and tutorials 8 years old)</p>
<p>Here we still miss the functions going to update the database with the new companies to add to the portfolio.</p>


<!-- all of this is just the ceckbox, it won't look like that in the end so no worries if you don't understand something -->
<p>You can add companies to it, as well as the number of shares you own:</p>
Name of Company : <div><input type="checkbox" id="comp1" name="comp1" value="Apple">
<label for="comp1"> Apple</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="comp2" name="comp2" value="Amazon">
<label for="comp2"> Amazon</label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="comp3" name="comp3" value="Oil">
<label for="comp3"> Oil</label><br></div>
<input type="button" value="update portfolio">
<!-- We submit this data to the database once validated by the user. Check boxes are just for the proof of concept, we paln on adding more accessible feature for this-->

<p>Your current porfolio is:</p>
[<script>printPortfolio(portfolio);</script>]
<br>
<!-- We add a link to the algorithm page -->
